The process of managing and sharing expenses within the group, or even tracking personal finances, is becoming an arduous task; these difficulties are often encountered during travel, tracking debt, household finance, and other expenditures that we come
across during our day-to-day activities. Existing expense management tools are solely relying on who-owes-whom concepts, but we are trying to be the one-sole destination for budget planning and financial tracking for their group and personal activities. Our
project, FairShare, is a web-based software prototype designed to address these challenges by unifying trip planning, expense tracking, and creating a seamless and collaborative environment for users to share their expenses.

The core idea of FairShare will be delivered through three primary modules:
1. The Trip Hub
A dedicated module that helps us to plan group travel which amalgamate financial management with trip planning. Before the trip, the group can set spending budgets for various categories, such as food, transportation, etc. As expenses are added, a progress bar
on the application will appear, giving the member of that group a clear picture of their spending. A collaborative to-do list for systematizing pre-trip tasks, such as booking tickets and creating a packing list.
2. Smart Settlement and Analytics:
This module offers to provide financial clarity and simplifying payments among the group. The application calculates the most coherent way to settle all debts, minimizing the number of transactions required among members of that group. The system allows users to track loans within the group, which
essentially simplifies the final group settlement for a complete and accurate financial summary. The application provides you with simple charts and graphs to better visualize the finances that occur within the group, offering a clear breakdown by category and showing the contribution of each member.
3. Expense Management:
This module gives you the ability to track your daily, weekly, and monthly expenses. The application calculates your daily, weekly and monthly expenses and tells you if you are overspending or not. The application gives you visual details about your spending bycategorizing your spending into different categories such as food, travel, groceries, etc. It allows you to create a checklist for important items that you need for your weekly and monthly expenses.
